#### About the Art Hop

Lake Champlain Chocolates factory store is located on Pine Street in Burlington, VT -- part of Burlington's "south end." Each year in September, a three day event is organized to celebrate the south end's amazing artist community. Businesses all up and down the Pine Street corridor become make-shift art galleries and there are over 500 participating artists showcasing paintings, sculptures, photography and yes ... even chocolate art.
