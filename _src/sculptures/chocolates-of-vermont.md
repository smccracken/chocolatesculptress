This centerpiece was on display during [A Sweet Symposium](https://shelburnemuseum.org/event/sweet-symposium-exploring-sweet-tooth-art-dessert/) at Shelburne Museum in October 2017. It draws inspiration from Lake Champlain Chocolates's [Chocolates of Vermont](https://www.lakechamplainchocolates.com/chocolate/chocolates-of-vermont/vermont-chocolate-gift-box) gift box. 

The company is a proud [sponsor of Shelburne Museum](https://shelburnemuseum.org/press-release/lake-champlain-chocolates-sponsorship-of-shelburne-museums-new-electric-shuttle-makes-for-a-sweet-ride/).

The museum described the event as a <q cite="https://shelburnemuseum.org/event/sweet-symposium-exploring-sweet-tooth-art-dessert/">lively day of conversation exploring the artwork and themes displayed in _Sweet Tooth: The Art of Dessert_.</q> Not only was I lucky enough to be a **featured presenter** during the symposium, but I also had the thrill of being asked to create a [**sculpture for the Sweet Tooth exhibit**](/sculptures/donut-shop/).

It was a really exciting time for me.
