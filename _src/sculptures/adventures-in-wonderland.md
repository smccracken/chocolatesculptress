Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and the follow-up, Through the Looking Glass, are my favorite stories of all-time. As a child, I loved the vivid and strange world that Carroll created (it wasn't until later I found out why he was able to come up with such peculiar ideas). Even as I studied art, I kept coming back to the various illustrations by John Tenniel. Over the years, I've collected 27 copies of the books.

For the 2015 Art Hop it seemed natural to combine my love of these stories with my love of chocolate. But with characters so rich and vibrant I knew the typical browns and whites of chocolate weren't going to cut it.

It was time to dust off the spray gun.
