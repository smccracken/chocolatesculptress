As seen on the "[Outrageous Chocolate](https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/outrageous/episodes/chocolate)" special on Food Network! 

This 5-foot tall, 65+ lbs sculpture is my largest build to date. The sculpture has an actual functioning clock that tells better time than my watch! Being invited to have a chocolate sculpture featured on Food Network is a dream come true! Thanks to my wonderful company [Lake Champlain Chocolates](http://www.lakechamplainchocolates.com/) and my friends and family for believing in me! Also thanks to Food Network for this wonderful honor!
