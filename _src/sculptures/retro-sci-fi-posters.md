**For my 2011 South End Art Hop I drew inspiration from my love of retro sci-fi movie posters.**

If you haven't picked up on it yet, I love all things retro. And what's more nostalgic then old movie posters? Especially those with colossal gorillas, crazy space robots and futuristic urban dystopias.

The movies I decided to base my sculptures on were:

### Metropolis (1927)

Metropolis is set in a futuristic urban dystopia, and follows characters overcoming trying to overcome the various classes of their city. It was the most expensive ever movie ever filmed at the time. It also featured the female robot Maschinenmensch, which is an awesome German word that translates to "machine human".

### King Kong (1933)

Everyone knows who King Kong is, but I wonder how many people have watched the original stop motion film? It's wonderful and deserves a viewing.

### Forbidden Planet (1956)

Considered one of the greatest sic-fi movies of all time, this was the first film depicted humans traveling in a starship of their own creation. Set entirely on another world in interstellar space, it really stretched people's imaginations.
