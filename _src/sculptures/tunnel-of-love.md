The _Tunnel of Love_ is one name given to "old mill" or "dark tunnel" rides, a popular 20th century amusement park staple where two-passenger boats were gently guided through dark tunnels. The ride invokes that classic American nostalgia that I simply can't get enough of. 

Hop a ride. ðŸ˜˜

In Dave Samuelson's book, _The American Amusement Park_, he explains tunnel rides were popular because <q cite="https://books.google.com/books?id=AgPM2u0NiAEC&pg=PT58&lpg=PT58&dq=the+darkness+became+a+big+draw+for+romantically+inclined+couples+looking+for+a+little+intimacy+in+a+time+when+any+public+display+of+affection+was+frowned+upon&source=bl&ots=ej4227HbsH&sig=ACfU3U0fsJCeZWgCs8qOlCt9a285zxoSYA&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjw9KDt3cTnAhU6g3IEHVn_CMAQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=the%20darkness%20became%20a%20big%20draw%20for%20romantically%20inclined%20couples%20looking%20for%20a%20little%20intimacy%20in%20a%20time%20when%20any%20public%20display%20of%20affection%20was%20frowned%20upon&f=false">the darkness became a big draw for romantically inclined couples looking for a little intimacy in a time when any public display of affection was frowned upon</q>.

Eventually amusement parks picked up on this and re-branded their tunnel rides as the _Tunnel of Love_. ðŸ˜˜

While researching I found it interesting that there were basically two versions of these rides. Some, like the _Tunnel of Love_, would be a relaxing rides through romantic scenery while others would be scarier rides meant to spook you.

Either way the goal was to get the two occupants to cling to one another.

At their peak there were over 700 of these _dark tunnel_ rides in the USA, but sadly they've mostly disappered now. I bet if they start handing out free chocolate at the beginning of the ride they'll make a comeback!
