The _Tunnel of Love_ was a popular name for an iconic early 20th century amusement park ride where riders were taken by two-passenger boats through dark tunnels. There were two iterations â€“ either a relaxing ride through romatic scenary, or a spooky ride through things that'll make you scream. Either way the goal was to have couples cling to one another.

For me the ride invokes that classic American nostalgia that I can't get enough of. Hop a ride. ðŸ˜˜

In Dave Samuelson's book, _The American Amusement Park_, he explains these rides were popular because <q cite="https://books.google.com/books?id=AgPM2u0NiAEC&pg=PT58&lpg=PT58&dq=the+darkness+became+a+big+draw+for+romantically+inclined+couples+looking+for+a+little+intimacy+in+a+time+when+any+public+display+of+affection+was+frowned+upon&source=bl&ots=ej4227HbsH&sig=ACfU3U0fsJCeZWgCs8qOlCt9a285zxoSYA&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjw9KDt3cTnAhU6g3IEHVn_CMAQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=the%20darkness%20became%20a%20big%20draw%20for%20romantically%20inclined%20couples%20looking%20for%20a%20little%20intimacy%20in%20a%20time%20when%20any%20public%20display%20of%20affection%20was%20frowned%20upon&f=false">the darkness became a big draw for romantically inclined couples looking for a little intimacy in a time when any public display of affection was frowned upon</q>. ðŸ˜˜
