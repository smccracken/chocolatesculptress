My 2014 Art Hop exhibit was based on the whimsy and industrial style of steampunk. For those who haven't heard of steampunk before, I've always been a fan of this definition from the [Ministry of Peculiar Occurrences](http://www.ministryofpeculiaroccurrences.com/what-is-steampunk/).

> "Steampunk is an inspired movement of creativity and imagination. With a backdrop of either Victorian England or America’s Wild West at hand, modern technologies are re-imagined and realized as elaborate works of art, fashion, and mechanics."

> "If Jules Verne or H.G. Wells were writing their science fiction today, it would be considered “steampunk.”

There's something very romantic and engaging about steampunk. Maybe it's the elaborate details, the dreamlike themes, or the peculiar blend of mechanical elements and historical fashion. Whatever it is I loved working in this genre and was able to generate five sculptures:

* **The Choctopus**: Yes, he's wearing a monocle.
* **Steampunk Top Hat**: Adorned with gears, feathers and goggles
* **Diver's Helmet**: Luster dust really gave this one a metallic feel
* **Geared Owl**: My 14-month old daughter's favorite
* **Submarine**: Utilitarian deep sea traversal

My sculptures will be on display at South End Kitchen in Burlington, VT starting on September 5th, 2014. Come check them out in person!
