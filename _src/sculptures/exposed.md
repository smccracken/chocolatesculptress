I was asked to create a chocolate centerpiece for [EXPOSED: The Barnstormers 7th Annual Winter Soirée](https://shelburnemuseum.org/event/exposed-the-barnstormers-7th-annual-winter-soiree/) at the Shelburne Museum. The party celebrated the ["Time Lapse: Contemporary Analog Photography"](https://shelburnemuseum.org/exhibition/time-lapse-contemporary-analog-photography/) exhibit at Shelburne Museum which features the work of photographers using 19th-century photographic techniques.

My inspiration was the cameras used for TinType photography which reached its peak popularity around 1870. I love the depth of these old cameras and used some relief techniques to pull the camera lens away from the base of the centerpiece.

As [Shelburne Museum](https://shelburnemuseum.org)  describes it this exhibit highlights those that <q cite="https://shelburnemuseum.org/exhibition/time-lapse-contemporary-analog-photography/">experiment with the mutable medium of photography and employing a variety of materials—from cyanotype dresses made of tamale wrappers to a three-dimensional shelter displaying tintype portraits</q>.

The exhibit is on display until March 8th, 2020.
