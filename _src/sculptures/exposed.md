I was asked to make a chocolate centerpiece for a party celebrating the [_Time Lapse: Contemporary Analog Photography_](https://shelburnemuseum.org/exhibition/time-lapse-contemporary-analog-photography/) exhibit at Shelburne Museum. The theme of the party was "exposed."

The exhibit celebrates artists who use the darkroom and 19th-century photographic techniques to create vintage works of art. Particularly those that <q cite="https://shelburnemuseum.org/exhibition/time-lapse-contemporary-analog-photography/">experiment with the mutable medium of photography and employing a variety of materialsâ€”from cyanotype dresses made of tamale wrappers to a three-dimensional shelter displaying tintype portraits</q>.

I used an old TinType camera as inspiration.
