Tryptic Press's yearly magazine, Chroma, interviewed me recently. I love their mission:

    text: "Chroma highlights the work of New England artists who encompass the passion, heart, and visual esthetic that they believe truly represents the area. Since 2013, Chroma has featured over 50 artists, hosted numerous art exhibitions, and helped shape they way people experience New England art."
