Thank you to the Times Argus staff for the front page image for their April 21, 2018 paper.

> _Emily McCracken, a chocolate sculptress from Lake Champlain Chocolates, is all smiles after successfully moving her creation to a pedestal Friday at Studio Place Arts in Barre. This sculpture of a Phoenix, made completely from edible chocolate, was created for the gallery's Big Arty SPA Happening (BASH) on Friday night._

Staff photographer Jeb Wallace-Broder snapped this photo shortly after we successful transported my [chocolate phoenix sculpture](/sculptures/phoenix/). That look on my face is one of pure RELIEF!
