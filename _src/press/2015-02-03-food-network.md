When the Food Network came calling it was a [dream come true](/journal/2015/a-dream-come-true/). They wanted a 5 foot tall chocolate sculpture to be featured on a Valentine's special called "Outrageous Chocolate." I had never built anything quite like it but that wasn't going to stop me from achieving my dream.
