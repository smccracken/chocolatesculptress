In 2008 I was featured in Mastercard's "Priceless Picks" campaign. MasterCard approached me about being part of the campaign after they came across images of my chocolate sculptures on the Flickr. I was incredibly surprised and flattered when I first received the inquiry from MasterCard. I almost thought it was a friend playing a prank!
