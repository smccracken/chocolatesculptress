Apple season is in full swing here in Vermont and there's no better time to start dipping them in caramel, nuts and chocolate. Last night I was on WCAX The :30 with a quick lesson on how to get started making your own caramel apples.

_Update: the video is no longer available on WCAX.com._

My thanks to the WCAX team for such a great time!
