For the 2015 Burlington, VT ArtHop I wanted to pay tribute to my favorite story of all-time â€“ Lewis Carroll's Adventures in Wonderland.

I tried to pick out some of my favorite scenes and find a way to represent them in chocolate. Narrowing it down was hard! There is so much rich and fantastical imagery in the book.
