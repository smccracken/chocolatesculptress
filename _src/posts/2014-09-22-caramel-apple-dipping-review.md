Thanks to everyone who came out to the [Lake Champlain Chocolates](http://www.lakechamplainchocolates.com/) and South End Kitchen caramel apple dipping session at [EatxNE](http://eatxne.com/). We started with 100 local apples and by the end of the afternoon each one had been dipped, swirled and devoured. That's a lot of sticky fingers! 

I hope you all had as much fun as I did. Leave a comment below and let us know what you thought!
